This is a basic build.sbt setup with the project settings specified a little bit differently than in the basic project

It uses the ```lazy val``` way of creating a  project with settings

Notice that there is a comma to separate the settings

These properties can be viewed by running sbt, then once the prompt appears, typing 'name' or 'version'
