This project is an example of sharing code between sbt files.  The definitions in .sbt files aren't visible in other .sbt files.  

Share code between .sbt files by creating .scala files and placing them in the ```project``` directory.  The code from these .scala files can then be accessed in the .sbt files of the root project and any subprojects
